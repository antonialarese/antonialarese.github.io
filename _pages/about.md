I am Associate Professor in  Maritime and Hydraulic  Constructions and Hydrology at the
University of Padova, Italy (2021) and Hans Fischer Fellow at the Institute of Advanced
Studies of the Technical University of Munich TUM-IAS, Germany (2021). 

I got my MSc in Civil Engineer (five years degree) by the University of Padova, Italy (2006), M.Sc.in Numerical Methods (2011) and PhD in Structural Analysis (2012) by the Technical University of
Catalonia (UPC), Spain. 

Between 2008 and 2018 I have been working at the International
Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering CIMNE, Barcelona and I have been part
time lecturer at the Civil Engineering School of UPC, Barcelona, Spain. My PhD thesis
was awarded the Special Doctorate Award by the UPC.

I have been awarded the Hans Fischer Fellowship of the TUM-IAS (2021), the Rita Levi Montalcini fellowship (2018-2021) by the Italian Ministry, the Juan de la Cierva fellowship (2016-2018) by the Spanish Ministry and the PDJ fellowship by the regional
Catalonian government (2014-2016).

I work in computational mechanics with special focus on coupled problems. I have worked with different numerical approaches, from finite elements, to continuum-based particle methods, in both Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks. I have worked on the development and combination
of different numerical techniques for the analysis of coupled problems accounting for
free surface flows, non-Newtonian materials and fluid-structure interaction including
unfitted techniques.
My main research focuses on the simulation of the impact of natural disasters on structures and protective systems.

I am part of the [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki)  community.

I am editor-in-chief of Advances in Computational Sciences and Engineering [ACSE](https://www.aimsciences.org/ACSE) journal.
